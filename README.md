# **System developer**

## Description
Systems developer develops software like a software developers. However the major difference is the type of software while software developers work on the frontend a systems developer works on the backend. The difference between the frontend and backend it that the frontend is what most computer applications are they usually have user interfaces to be more user friendly and are the part that you interact with most of the time. The backend on the other hand is usually used for processing it is not usually accessible to users it also usually lacks a user interfaces.

## Education
To become a systems developer usually requires a bachelor of computer science or software engineering.

## Technical and non-technical skills required: 

## Salary range
The base salary range for a systems developer in on Ontario according to payscale.com is $49k CAD to $103k CAD with a average of $71k CAD.

# Learning From Experience
There are other ways to gain experience outside of school here are some of the differnt options for acquiring valuable experience and skills.
‎

‎
## 1. Competitive Programming Competitions
The first way to obtain experience is by participating in competitive programming competitions. These competitions are great for improving your logical thinking and problem solving skills because most of the questions are heavily math based. Not just that if you're doing competitive programming this means that you're probably practicing before the competition so this practice also contributes to your experience.
‎

‎
## 2. Decompiling Programs For Fun
Another way to obtain experience is by decompiling programs for fun. This is a great way to learn more about how those programs work but more importantly it helps you to understand how the compiler works and how code actually interacts with the hardware. 
‎

‎
## 3. Creating Video Game Cheats
Similarly to the previous you can also learn more about how applications actually work by creating video game cheats. Working with memory editing can teach you about pointers and how variables are stored in memory. Depending on the game it can also teach about drivers and the operating system specifically when dealing with kernel cheats. Actually this is the reason why I wanted to learn programming in the first place from there my interests grew and now I want to know more about everything to do with computers.
‎

‎
## 4. Creating Software For Fun
Finally one of the best ways to gain experience is by creating system software for fun. If you have a neat idea why not try and make it there is plenty of information available on the web and you can also see how other people do by looking at open source software. Even if your software never comes to fruition or is not how you want it to be it was still a great learning experience. You can never get better at creating things if you don’t keep trying. That's why I create everything that comes to mind.
